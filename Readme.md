**ML Project-2: Insurance Cost Predictor**

The goal of this project is to develop a regression analysis model that can estimate insurance costs for individuals. The model takes into account different variables such as age, BMI, smoking status, region, and number of children. By analyzing these factors, the model can provide accurate predictions for insurance costs.

**Project Structure**

The project structure follows a standard organization:

**src/components:**
Contains the components used in the project.

**src/pipelines:**
Stores the pipelines used for data preprocessing and model training.

**src/logger.py:** 
Logs necessary information and exceptions that occur during the project.

**src/exception.py:** 
Handles custom exceptions that may arise during project execution.


**Components**

The project components, located in the src/components directory, handle various tasks related to insurance cost prediction. These components may include data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

**Pipelines**

The src/pipelines directory stores pipelines responsible for data preprocessing and model training. These pipelines define the sequence of operations performed on the dataset to prepare it for training the machine learning model.

**Usage**

To use this project, please follow these steps:

Install the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.
Execute the project by running the main script or using the provided CLI commands.
